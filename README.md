# Frugal-Finder
FrugalFinder is a application that helps our users save money on groceries by comparing store prices, identifying coupons and member deals, and suggesting an optimized travel plan (including gas costs) for the lowest total spending. Our goal is to make grocery shopping more affordable and convenient for everyone.


## Goals
- Price Comparison: Aggregate and compare up-to-date prices from local grocery stores.
- Cost-Optimized Routes: Provide a GPS-based route that minimizes driving costs and time.
- Coupon Integration: Incorporate discounts and membership deals from different retailers.
