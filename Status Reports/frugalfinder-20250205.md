## [Di Ramirez-Diaz]

### Goals for the Week
- Work on system architecture/design section. Start working on web scraper.

### Progress and Issues
- Tasks completed:
  - Finished the system architecture/design.
- Key learnings:
  - Different approaches/templates for system design.
- Issues encountered:
  - Trying to figure out scrapers. Should we scrape HTML or network requests. What are the pros and cons, HTML is more feasible but tedious. Network requests are harder to understand but information the received is easy to parse.

### Goals for Next Week
- Have our scraper design figured out, decided our approach on either HTML or network requests.
