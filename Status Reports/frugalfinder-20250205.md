### [David Lym]

#### Goals for the Week
- Continue coding the react-native front end and connecting googleMaps API

#### Progress and Issues
- Tasks completed:
  - Finished setting up the dependencies and packages needed for the environment.
  - Create a google API and learned a little more about its usuage.
- Key learnings:
  - I learned more about git and version controll, along with how I can use googleMaps API .
- Issues encountered:
  - The environment is unusually difficult to set up, needed more research on how to reslove issues &
  api costs.
  - Solution: Do a little more research into what dependencies needed to be installed,
  (had to install Android Studio for SDK & Emulator).

#### Goals for Next Week
- Get a working Map in the app - Estimated time: [4 hours]
- Figure out how to set points from algorithm into maps - Estimated time: [5~ hours]

## [Nathan Moreland]

### Goals for the Week
- The goal for this week is to get a clear idea of what we can start coding.

### Progress and Issues
- Tasks completed:
  - Software Architecture document
  - Database/backend diagram
- Key learnings:
  - How to design backend
  - Designing UI/UX
- Issues encountered:
  - We had lots of different ideas about how to web scrape/when to web scrape.
      - We will understand more once it begins to be realized

### Goals for Next Week
- Setup Firebase
- Rough working UI
- Understand how webscraper connects to database

## [Jimmy Le]

### Goals for the Week
- Continue to work on the webscrapper and being able to scrape all items for a specific search query.
- Start looking at setting up Firestore DB.

### Progress and Issues
- Tasks completed:
  - Created a scrapper file and began the development of the scrapper tool particularly focusing on being able to scrape by using the backend api website use to populate the front end instead of grabbing raw html from the front page.
- Key learnings:
  - There are a lot of pre built tools that help you do this such as Insomnia and Panda.
  - These tool help organize adn format the response request as a json back to us. Panda is specifically use to convert this data in a readbale .xml file which can be used to set up in a DB view format.
- Issues encountered:
  - learning curve for understanding these libraries are very hard.
  - Selenium is good for virtually mimicking a browser opening to avoid bot detection however it isn't good for modern website with dynamic front end features.

### Goals for Next Week
- Finish the web scrapping tool and begin setting it up to fill the DB.
- Start looking towards setting up a rough front end to communicate to our back end.

## [Di Ramirez-Diaz]

### Goals for the Week
- Work on system architecture/design section. Start working on web scraper.

### Progress and Issues
- Tasks completed:
  - Finished the system architecture/design.
- Key learnings:
  - Different approaches/templates for system design.
- Issues encountered:
  - Trying to figure out scrapers. Should we scrape HTML or network requests. What are the pros and cons, HTML is more feasible but tedious. Network requests are harder to understand but information the received is easy to parse.

### Goals for Next Week
- Have our scraper design figured out, decided our approach on either HTML or network requests.

## [Vladyslav Boiko]

### Goals for the Week
- Help develop architecture schematic: [3 hours]
- Start researching how webscrapers function [3 hours]

### Progress and Issues
- Tasks completed:
  - Finished our system design architecture.
- Key learnings:
  - A lot of different system designs.
- Issues encountered:
  - How our Firestore database will work? Do we need indexes or if we update database super frequently it will slow it down?
  - What items we will parse and do we need to store every single item from each store?

### Goals for Next Week
- Work on the webscraper for Safeway/TraderJoe's food products: [5 hours]
- Design database on Firestore DB: [5 hours]

## [Ronin Crawford]

### Goals for the Week
- Help develop architecture schematic: [3 hours]
- Start researching how the AWS cloud infrastructure works [2 hours]

### Progress and Issues
- Tasks completed:
  - Help develop architecture schematic
  - Switched to Firebase, started research on it
- Key learnings:
  - I gained a much clearer picture of how the project is going to be set up and developed
- Issues encountered:
  - I struggled to come up with risks for our project, which was fixed by talking more with other members of the team
  - Originally we planned to use AWS, but then switched to Firebase, so I had to switch what I was learning about

### Goals for Next Week
- Start setting up the back-end and database to get ready for a beta test - Estimated time: [2 hours]
- Work on the testing and continuous integration plan - Estimated time: [3 hours]
